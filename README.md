# A port of [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) to [Keras](https://keras.io) framework.
For more details, please refer to [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).
Originally from https://github.com/rykov8/ssd_keras

Weights are ported from the original models and are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!7RowVLCL!q3cEVRK9jyOSB9el3SssIA). You need `weights_SSD300.hdf5`, `weights_300x300_old.hdf5` is for the old version of architecture with 3x3 convolution for `pool6`.
